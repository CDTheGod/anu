        <p>I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to address something that has been weighing on my mind since yesterday. I want to sincerely apologize for the unintentional comment I made that upset you. Reflecting on it, I realize how insensitive and thoughtless my words were, and I deeply regret causing you any distress.</p>

        <p>Please know that it was never my intention to hurt you or make you feel uncomfortable in any way. I value our friendship immensely, and the last thing I want is for something like this to come between us. Your happiness and well-being mean a lot to me, and I'm genuinely sorry for any pain my words may have caused.</p>

        <p>I understand if you need some time and space to process this, but I hope we can eventually move past this misunderstanding. If there's anything I can do to make things right or if you'd like to talk about it further, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm here to listen and learn from my mistakes.</p>

        <p>Once again, I'm truly sorry for my insensitive remark, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.</p>

        <p>Yours truly,</p>
